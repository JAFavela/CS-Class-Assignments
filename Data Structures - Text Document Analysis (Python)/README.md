# Text Document Analysis
The purpose of this program is to perform elementary analysis of text documents eﬃciently using hash tables. The program reads a text ﬁle and ﬁnds the content word that appears the most times in the ﬁle. A content word is a word that is likely to be related to the document’s topic. This is done by ﬁrst extracting all the words in the ﬁle to a list and then removing from that list all the words that appear in a list of stop words, which are the most-commonly used words in the English language and thus are assumed to provide little content information. Examples of stop words include the, and, a, this, that, for and in. The occurrences of all the words in that list are then counted returning the one with the most occurrences.

To test your program, I used a set of abstracts obtained from the scientiﬁc literature in neuroscience. The stop words are in the stop_words.txt file.
