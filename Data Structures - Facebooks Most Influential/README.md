# Facebooks Most Influential 
The purpose of this program is to determine the most influetial persone given a real-world dataset that contains information about annonymized facebook friendship relationships. To achieve this I implemented 2 different types of algorithms, one based on simulation (Random Walk) and one based on iterative probabilistic computations. To test the program I used the Ô¨Åle facebook_combined.txt which contains two integers per line, representing the source and destination vertices in an undirected graph.
